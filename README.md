## Key Features

Evolve Forms offers a range of features that extend the capabilities of your Salesforce instance, allowing you to better support your organization's diverse needs. Some of the key features include:

### Dynamic Page Layouts and Field Sections

Evolve Forms enables you to dynamically render multiple page layouts or field sections based on virtually any set of criteria. This flexibility eliminates the need to create multiple record types, making it easier to tailor your application to the unique needs of your different business units.

### Field Customization

With Evolve Forms, you can optionally override the label and/or help text of fields to provide business unit-specific context. This allows you to offer your users a better understanding of how a field should be used in the context of their team's processes.

### Calculated Values

You can render computed values on a record with complex criteria, going beyond the capabilities of standard formula fields. Evolve Forms provides a solution that doesn't consume a field in the sObject's schema, giving you greater flexibility and control.

### User Confirmation

Evolve Forms allows you to intercept the save operation and prompt users to confirm the accuracy of the information they entered. These conditionally rendered dynamic warning messages can improve data integrity and accuracy.

### Custom Component Integration

With Evolve Forms, you can choreograph custom components seamlessly with the same set of edit, save, and cancel buttons as the rest of the page. This creates a cohesive and user-friendly experience, enhancing interactions for your users.
